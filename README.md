# Math Skills Program

This program calculates and prints statistics for a given dataset. The statistics include:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

The program reads data from a file and prints the results in rounded integer format.

## Usage

To test the program, follow these steps:

1. Save the provided Go code in a file, for example, `main.go`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Create a data file by running this command `./math-skills` in the terminal.  
   This will create a file called `data.txt` in the current directory. The terminal output from this 
   command is the correct output that should match the output of `main.go`.  
4. Run the program with the following command, replacing `data.txt` with the path to your data file:

   ```bash
   $ go run main.go data.txt
